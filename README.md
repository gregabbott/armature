# Armature
Generate composition guides and armatures for design and visual work based on classical art theory. Save them as ready to use lightweight SVG vector files, and PNG raster images.

The tool includes a simple user interface with presets for harmonic symmetry, dynamic symmetry, rabatment, and other baroque ideas.

The project packs everything into a single html file tool that can run offline in a web browser with JavaScript enabled.
